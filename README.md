### ðŸŒ± My values:

Stay curious and never stop learning  

### ðŸ’» My tech stack:

My journey spans full-stack development, operations, and DevOps, enriched by building a campus project that organically reached 2,000+ users. 

I currently focus on TypeScript development while exploring Dart.

### ðŸ“š Recent plans:

- I'm committed to continuously absorbing high-quality knowledge through curated subscriptions, reading, and watching in-depth long-form videos.

- I'm currently vibe coding my new app: **ReadeckApp** â€” a mobile-first read-later experience built on top of Readeck, designed to enhance my mobile reading workflow.

- I'm actively exploring and learning AI technologies. I believe AI requires deliberate practice and intentional learning. The experience of vibe coding with Trae has been incredibly rewarding.
